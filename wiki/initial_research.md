Architectural Blueprint for the GO-Commerce MCP Service1. Architectural Blueprint: The GO-Commerce MCP ServiceThe development of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service for GO-Commerce represents a strategic initiative to evolve the platform from a traditional e-commerce application into an intelligent, AI-driven ecosystem. The MCP, an open standard introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, provides a standardized framework for secure, two-way communication between artificial intelligence systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and external data sources and tools.1 For GO-Commerce, this service will function as a secure bridge, enabling AI to move beyond its static training data and access live, private, and tenant-specific information.This architecture fundamentally augments the LLM’s knowledge with real-time, domain-specific data, a pattern known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).2 By providing the LLM with up-to-date and factual context from the GO-Commerce platform, the MCP service will reduce the risk of AI hallucinations and significantly increase the utility of AI for merchants, allowing for more accurate and automated business operations.21.1. Defining the MCP and Its Place in the EcosystemThe MCP's core components are the host, client, and server.2 In the context of GO-Commerce, these components map directly to the platform's architecture:MCP Host: The LLM environment (e.g., Gemini) that initiates a query. This is the ultimate consumer of the MCP service.MCP Client: A component within the LLM host that translates requests for the MCP Server.MCP Server: The custom microservice that will be built for GO-Commerce. This server will act as the crucial "bridge," securely connecting the LLM to the platform's back-end systems. It will be responsible for resolving tenant context, enforcing security policies, and translating LLM requests into actionable database queries and API calls.2The MCP Service will integrate as a new, purpose-built microservice within the existing GO-Commerce ecosystem, leveraging the internal APIs, Apache Kafka event streams, and direct database access. The following architectural blueprint provides a clear overview of how the MCP's logical components will map to the physical and conceptual layers of the GO-Commerce platform, serving as a definitive reference for the development team.MCP Logical ComponentGO-Commerce Architectural LayerRole within the SystemMCP Host (LLM)External AI EnvironmentOriginates requests for data and actions.MCP Client (in LLM Host)GO-Commerce Proxy/AdapterTranslates LLM requests into MCP calls.MCP Server (Custom Service)New Quarkus MicroserviceThe core business logic layer.Data & Context ProviderPostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, KeycloakProvides live, multi-tenant data and context.Backend SystemsExisting GO-Commerce MicroservicesExecutes actions and provides data for the MCP.1.2. Deeper Insights and Causal RelationshipsA foundational understanding of the MCP's role indicates that the custom service is not a simple data endpoint; it is a context-aware proxy. The service must be capable of dynamically understanding the tenant context from an incoming request. A simple API endpoint that takes a storeId as a parameter would introduce security vulnerabilities and fail to respect the platform's architecture. The MCP server must dynamically resolve the tenant from an authenticated user's JSON Web Token (JWT) claim or a URL.5 This requires building a robust, tenant-aware layer at the application level that can also handle the hierarchical roles defined in Keycloak, ensuring the LLM's requests adhere to the same role-based access control (RBAC) rules as a human user.5The application of RAG to multi-tenant data is not a simple database query; it is a security-critical operation. While standard RAG involves querying a general knowledge base to augment a prompt 3, the GO-Commerce "knowledge base" is the live, private data of its merchants.10 A data leak where information from one tenant is accidentally exposed to another would be catastrophic.12 Consequently, every single data retrieval operation must be intrinsically tied to the tenant context, with an absolute and unbreakable guarantee of data isolation. The platform's existing StoreContext.setCurrentStore() mechanism is a clear signal that this is the most critical constraint.2. Core Principles & Multi-Tenancy PatternsThe GO-Commerce multi-tenant architecture is built on the "Shared Database, Separate Schemas" pattern.10 This model provides a strong balance between data isolation and resource efficiency, making it an ideal fit for a scalable SaaS platform. The MCP service must be designed from the ground up to respect and leverage this foundational architectural choice.In this model, each merchant operates within their own PostgreSQL schema (e.g., store_myshop) within a single database instance.10 The application's persistence layer, which uses Hibernate ORM with Panache, must dynamically connect to the correct schema based on the active tenant context.2.1. The Critical Role of the TenantResolverThe success of the MCP's database interactions hinges on the TenantResolver component. While research confirms that Quarkus supports multi-tenancy with Hibernate ORM in SCHEMA mode, a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to implement a TenantResolver specifically for Hibernate Panache is noted as a significant technical gap.16 This indicates that the development team will need to create a custom implementation. A common approach for this is to inject the RoutingContext to retrieve the tenant identifier, which is then used to programmatically set the Hibernate MultiTenantConnectionProvider.14 The ability of the MCP service to correctly switch schemas on every request is entirely dependent on the robustness and correctness of this custom component.2.2. Unifying the Ecosystem: A Data Context LayerThe GO-Commerce platform follows a package-by-feature code organization, where code is grouped by business domain rather than technical layer.16 While this enhances modularity, the MCP service will need to query data from multiple, disparate domains (e.g., product catalog, order processing, customer management). This requires the MCP to either have broad dependencies on all these packages or to operate through a central "data context" layer. This layer would function as a "narrow waist," as described in research on data context services for machine learning, acting as a single point of access to all multi-tenant data.18 This approach unifies the disparate business domains for the LLM, effectively making the MCP service GO-Commerce's bespoke implementation of a "Data Context Service" and a powerful tool for innovation, efficiency, and governance.183. Technical Implementation: The Quarkus & Java FoundationThe MCP service will be built as a new Quarkus microservice, leveraging the platform's core benefits of fast startup times, low memory consumption, and high throughput.20 The foundation is a modern Java 21 environment, which introduces a number of performance-enhancing features.3.1. Database Integration with PanacheThe implementation will utilize Hibernate ORM with Panache for database interactions.16 This provides a streamlined, active-record-style API that simplifies common operations. The primary technical requirement is ensuring all Panache operations respect the tenant context. For example, a query like Person.find("name =?1", "stef") 16 is intrinsically safer than manually concatenating strings into SQL, which is a critical consideration for a service that will be driven by dynamic LLM prompts.3.2. Performance and Concurrency with Java 21The GO-Commerce platform is built on Java 21, which includes Project Loom's virtual threads.22 This is a significant development for an I/O-bound application like the MCP service, which will spend a considerable amount of time waiting on network calls to databases, caching services, and other APIs.25Quarkus is a pragmatic framework that unifies imperative and reactive programming.26 The MCP service can leverage a hybrid concurrency model, which is the most effective approach for this type of workload.27 Traditional blocking I/O operations can lead to thread pool exhaustion and high memory usage, a problem that Quarkus’s reactive architecture already mitigates by using a small number of event loop threads for non-blocking I/O.24 The strategic benefit of Java 21's virtual threads is that they allow for a synchronous, easy-to-read programming style while the JVM automatically "unpins" the underlying OS thread when it encounters a blocking operation.24 This creates a powerful synergy: Quarkus's reactive core can seamlessly offload blocking tasks—such as complex database queries—to virtual threads, achieving both high concurrency and simplified, more maintainable code.274. Security and Data GovernanceSecurity and tenant isolation are not optional features but foundational requirements for the GO-Commerce MCP service.11 Any accidental cross-tenant data exposure would be a catastrophic failure.4.1. Authentication and AuthorizationThe MCP service will leverage the existing Keycloak infrastructure and its hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC).9 All incoming requests will be authenticated via JWT bearer tokens.5 The quarkus-keycloak-authorization extension will be used to enforce dynamic permissions, centralizing policy management in Keycloak and reducing the need for security logic in the application code.9 The service's custom TenantResolver must not only identify the tenant but also validate that the authenticated user has the necessary roles for the requested operation within that tenant's context.54.2. Data Isolation and ProtectionWhile the schema-per-tenant model provides strong data isolation 10, a defense-in-depth strategy is essential. The analysis proposes using a secondary, non-violable layer of PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) as a crucial fallback.29The TenantResolver can be configured to not only set the schema but also to set a session_variable in PostgreSQL (e.g., SET app.current_organization_id).29 This means that even if a developer accidentally writes a query that does not reference the correct schema, the database's RLS policy will automatically filter the results, preventing a cross-tenant data leak. This transforms a potential code flaw into a harmless, zero-result query, providing a robust layer of protection for tenant data.15 The following matrix illustrates how security is enforced at multiple layers:Security LayerMechanism(s)Role in the MCP ServiceApplication LayerJWT Validation, TenantResolver, Role-based Access ControlAuthenticates the user and resolves the tenant from the request context.

Business Intelligence & Analytics: Advanced Use CasesEnabling business intelligence (BI) and analytics is a key objective for the MCP service.30 However, cross-tenant reporting, which involves aggregating data across multiple schemas, presents significant architectural and security challenges.32Allowing an LLM to freely query across all tenant schemas is a major security risk. The approach to cross-tenant data aggregation must be architected as a distinct, highly-privileged operation, not as a standard MCP query.33 A more secure and scalable solution is to implement a separate service that performs nightly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to a data warehouse, which contains pre-aggregated, anonymized, or non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data.19 This is a variation of a "bridge" tenancy model.37 The LLM can then query this secure, pre-aggregated data source, which separates the OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) of the core platform from the OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) of the BI layer. The MCP service can be configured to route a specific class of queries (e.g., "platform-level analytics") to this secure data source, thereby maintaining security while providing invaluable business-level insights.6. Operations & MaintenanceFor the MCP service to be a good citizen in the GO-Commerce microservice landscape, it must have robust debugging, monitoring, and performance management capabilities.6.1. Development Workflow IntegrationThe MCP service will be containerized with Docker, aligning with the existing platform setup.38 This enables a streamlined development experience with hot reloading, which is a core benefit of the Quarkus framework.8 For debugging, a shift beyond simple logging is required. The most valuable tool for debugging a multi-tenant, event-driven service is distributed tracing.39 A single user request (e.g., from Gemini to the MCP) can trigger multiple internal service calls and Kafka events.39 Without distributed tracing, it would be extremely difficult to follow the "transaction" as it moves across services. The development team will implement correlation IDs that are passed in the request headers and Kafka event metadata.39 This unique ID will be included in all logs and traces, allowing the team to instantly filter and visualize the complete journey of a single request, transforming debugging from a manual exercise into a data-driven process.396.2. Performance and ScalabilityThe MCP service is an I/O-intensive application, and managing database connections will be critical for performance. While Quarkus uses its own connection pooler, Agroal, the analysis indicates that using an external pooler like PgBouncer is a best practice for a multi-tenant PostgreSQL setup.44PostgreSQL uses a process-based model for connections, which can be inefficient for a large number of concurrent clients.44 PgBouncer acts as a lightweight proxy, maintaining a smaller, more efficient pool of persistent connections to the database.47 This directly mitigates the "noisy neighbor" problem, where a heavy workload from one tenant can monopolize database connections and degrade performance for all others.37 The use of PgBouncer, with its ability to manage resource quotas per-user and per-database, is a critical component for managing multi-tenant scalability and resource isolation at the database layer.497.

Conclusion & Strategic RecommendationsThe development of the MCP service is a transformative project for GO-Commerce. The analysis confirms that the proposed architecture is not only feasible but also aligns with modern, cloud-native best practices for microservices and multi-tenancy. The strategic value of this service lies in its ability to empower merchants with AI-driven capabilities while maintaining the platform's core tenets of security, scalability, and operational efficiency.The most significant technical challenges—the custom TenantResolver implementation for schema-based multi-tenancy and the secure handling of cross-tenant analytics—have been identified and can be mitigated with a meticulous focus on architectural principles. The defense-in-depth security model, which combines application-level security with a database-level fallback (RLS), provides an unbreakable guarantee of data isolation. Furthermore, the strategic use of Java 21’s virtual threads and an external connection pooler like PgBouncer will ensure the service is highly performant and scalable.It is recommended to proceed with this project, strictly adhering to the proposed phased roadmap. This approach will allow the team to validate core security and data isolation principles early on, providing a solid foundation for the integration of advanced features. The long-term benefits in terms of platform utility and merchant value far outweigh the technical complexity of this undertaking.
