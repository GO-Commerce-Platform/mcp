## Technical Specification

### Architecture Impact
- [ ] **New API Endpoints**: List all new REST endpoints with HTTP methods
- [ ] **Database Changes**: Schema modifications, new tables, indexes
- [ ] **Security Implications**: Authentication, authorization, data privacy considerations
- [ ] **Integration Points**: How this feature interacts with other services
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy Considerations**: How tenant isolation is maintained

### API Design
```yaml
# OpenAPI specification snippet
paths:
  /api/v1/your-endpoint:
    get:
      summary: Brief description
      parameters:
        - name: example
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/YourResponse'
```

### Data Models
```java
// Example entity or DTO classes
public record FeatureDto(
    UUID id,
    String name,
    // Add all relevant fields
) {}
```

### Business Rules
1. **Validation Rules**: What data constraints must be enforced?
2. **Business Logic**: Key workflows and decision points
3. **Error Conditions**: How should edge cases be handled?

## Implementation Plan

### Dependencies
- [ ] **Upstream**: What must be completed before this feature?
- [ ] **Downstream**: What features depend on this implementation?
- [ ] **External**: Third-party services or libraries required

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Functional**: Core feature behavior works as specified
- [ ] **Non-Functional**: Performance, security, scalability requirements met
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test data scenarios defined

- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, empty data, maximum limits
- [ ] **Error Cases**: Invalid inputs, system failures, network issues
- [ ] **Security**: Unauthorized access, malformed tokens, cross-tenant access

### Test Data Requirements
- Multi-tenant test scenarios with realistic data
- Performance test data volumes
- Security test cases with various token types

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- [ ] **ADR Required**: Does this feature require an architectural decision record?
- [ ] **ADR Created**: Link to ADR document if applicable

## Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: What metrics should be tracked?
- **Logging**: What events should be logged for debugging?
- **Alerts**: What conditions should trigger notifications?

## Documentation Requirements
