# GO-Commerce MCP â€“ Actionable Task Checklist

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Git/GitHub Workflow Reminders**
- **NEVER close GitHub issues manually** - let PR merges auto-close them
- **Always check** `git status` before any `gh issue close` command  
- **Use feature branches**: `feature/MCP-{issue#}-{name}`
- **Link PRs properly**: Include "Closes #issue-number" in PR descriptions
- **Emergency recovery**: If issue closed prematurely, commit changes â†’ create PR â†’ reference closed issue
- **See WARP.md** for complete Git/GitHub workflow documentation
