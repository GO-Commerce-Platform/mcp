# GO-Commerce MCP – Actionable Task Checklist

Each task is a single, minimal, independently implementable unit of work. Check off items as you complete them. Suggested branch names and commit prefixes are included to keep work synced with Git.

Note: Use feature branches per task where practical. Commit with conventional commits, reference the task name, and open PRs as needed.
